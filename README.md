# Cat-Dog-Classification

We Tested our models structure from  [Gender-Classification Project](https://github.com/waleed-abdelkarim/Gender-Classification) to another task which is Cat-Dog classification.

•	The Dataset used was ~10k pictures of both animals in different folders. 

•	Dataset Link: [Cat and Dog](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog)

•	Other pre-trained CNNs used for comparison: 
 
   o	MobileNetV2 

   o	ResNet50V2 

   o	Xception 

   o	VGG16 

   o	InceptionV3 


Here you can compare the original code (model) with our updated code with other pre-trained CNNs:

here the pre-trained CNNs give us a much higher acuuracy.
